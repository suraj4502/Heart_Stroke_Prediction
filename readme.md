# Heart Stroke Predictor

## Project Overview
This machine learning project addresses a binary classification problem to predict the likelihood of a patient experiencing a heart stroke based on various health and demographic factors. It serves as a valuable tool for early risk assessment and preventive healthcare.

## Models and Performance
